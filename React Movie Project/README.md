# 🎬 React Movie App — Frontend

A modern movie discovery frontend built using **React**, focused on component-driven architecture, API integration, and scalable frontend structure.

This project demonstrates practical React development patterns used in real-world applications and is inspired from the tutorials shown in the YouTube Channel: `Tech with Tim`

**NOTE:** The project was independently implemented based on concepts learned from Tech With Tim’s content. All code was written manually to ensure conceptual understanding and demonstrate ownership of the implementation.

## 🚀 Project Summary

The application fetches and displays movie data dynamically, allowing users to browse and navigate between views without page reloads using client-side routing.

**Core Objective:** Build a production-style React frontend as part of a MERN stack learning workflow.
